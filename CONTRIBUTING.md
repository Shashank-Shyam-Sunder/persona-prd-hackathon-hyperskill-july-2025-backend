# 🤝 Contributing to PersonaPRD

Hi team! 👋 Thanks for contributing to our AI Hackathon project — *PersonaPRD*.

To keep our collaboration smooth and organized, please follow the workflow and rules below.

---

## 🔐 Branch Protection

The `main` branch is protected. Only @shashank can push directly to `main` at least for this backend repo.

This ensures we review all changes before they are merged into our stable codebase.

---

## 🚀 How to Suggest or Contribute Changes

### 1. Create a New Branch

From your terminal:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
```

Or create one directly on GitHub.

> Tip: Use clear branch names like `feature/backend-api` or `fix/cluster-bug`.

---

### 2. Make Changes Locally

Commit your changes with meaningful messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add endpoint for summarizing clusters"
git push origin feature/backend-api
```

---

### 3. Open a Pull Request (PR)

- Go to our GitHub repo
- Click **"Compare & pull request"**
- Fill in a clear title and description
- Assign it to @shashank or tag teammates if needed

---

### 4. Code Review & Merge

Only @shashank will merge PRs into `main`.  
If feedback is given, feel free to update your PR branch and push again — it will update the same PR.

---

## ✅ Do’s

- ✅ Keep PRs focused and concise
