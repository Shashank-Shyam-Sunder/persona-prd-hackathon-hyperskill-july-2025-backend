0,48,"Cursor's new pricing model is causing widespread confusion and frustration among users.  Many report unpredictable and rapidly reached rate limits, even on Pro plans, leading to significantly increased costs and interrupted workflows. The lack of clear communication and inconsistent application of pricing tiers across models adds to the overall negative user experience."
1,61,"Users struggle with AI coding assistants' inconsistencies, context retention, and adherence to rules, leading to inefficient workflows and low-quality code.  The need for frequent re-prompts and manual corrections significantly hinders productivity, especially in larger, more complex projects.  Many users desire improved code quality and local-first functionality similar to competing products, while expressing concerns about the increasing focus on ""vibe coding"" over professional development needs."
2,45,"Cursor's recent pricing changes and implementation have caused widespread user frustration.  The lack of transparency regarding usage limits and rate limits, coupled with degraded performance and unexpected costs, is leading to mass user churn and dissatisfaction.  Users feel betrayed by the shift from a previously understood pricing model to an opaque, usage-based system that significantly impacts their workflow and productivity."
3,58,"Cursor users experience frequent, critical bugs impacting functionality, data loss, and security.  These range from UI freezes and data corruption to unexpected code generation, including malicious code in some instances, along with inconsistent and unreliable extension support.  Lack of responsiveness from Cursor support exacerbates these issues."
4,34,"Users are experiencing frequent and unpredictable rate limits across various Cursor AI models, regardless of subscription tier.  This severely impacts productivity and undermines the value proposition of paid plans, particularly the ""unlimited"" options, due to a lack of transparency and clear indication of usage limits or refresh times.  The opaque nature of the rate limiting system causes significant frustration and wasted time."
5,67,"Users experience significant frustration with Cursor's lack of reliable customer support, particularly concerning bug resolution and slow response times, impacting productivity and potentially leading to subscription cancellations.  Inconsistent performance, including issues with code generation, UI design, and integration with other tools, further diminishes user satisfaction.  The lack of transparency around pricing changes and feature updates also contributes to negative sentiment."
6,44,"Users experience significant frustration with the reliability and performance of various AI coding assistants, particularly Gemini,  due to frequent rate limiting, inconsistent code quality, unreliable tool calls, and unexplained model removals or changes.  This leads to wasted time, increased costs, and a general lack of trust in the ability of these tools to consistently deliver accurate and efficient results."
7,44,"Users experience frequent rate limits and context limitations with both Cursor and Claude.  The inconsistent code quality and differing capabilities between Cursor and Claude, along with the lack of seamless integration between the two platforms, creates workflow friction and necessitates switching between tools.  This leads to frustration with context loss, debugging complexities, and inefficient development processes."
8,51,"Cursor's Pro plan, advertised as ""unlimited,"" unexpectedly imposes hidden rate limits and unclear usage-based pricing, leading to frequent interruptions and inconsistent service for paying users.  This lack of transparency regarding limits and model switching, coupled with inconsistent billing and unresponsive customer support, causes significant frustration and undermines the value proposition of the subscription.  Users report feeling deceived by misleading marketing and demand improved clarity and reliability."
9,48,"Cursor users experience significant frustration with unreliable code generation, frequent bugs impacting workflow (including unintended file changes and broken auto-completion), and difficulty using features like background agents and MCPs.  The inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior across different models and features severely impact productivity and user confidence."
