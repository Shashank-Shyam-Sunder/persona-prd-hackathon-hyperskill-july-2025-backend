0,14,"Data professionals struggle with efficient data cleaning and manipulation techniques, particularly when dealing with inconsistencies like overlapping date ranges and outliers.  They need robust automated solutions for validating data, identifying problematic observations, and performing granular time-based data extraction and splitting for analysis and visualization.  Furthermore, there's a need for streamlined methods to clean data directly within databases, avoiding cumbersome import/export processes."
1,28,"The core pain point is the difficulty and cost of data cleaning, particularly for large datasets and diverse data types (e.g., images, emails, CRM data).  Users seek efficient, affordable, and user-friendly tools and services to automate data cleaning processes, improve data quality, and streamline workflows for various applications, from machine learning to e-commerce.  A lack of readily available APIs for simple data cleaning tasks is also a significant concern."
2,25,"Many users struggle with cleaning and standardizing messy, unstructured data from various sources, including free text logs, CSV files, scanned documents, and XML.  This data often contains inconsistencies, typos, incomplete information, and varying formats, hindering analysis and data integration.  The need for efficient automated solutions to extract, clean, and standardize this data is consistently highlighted."
3,26,"Data cleaning is time-consuming and expensive, hindering productivity for individuals and businesses.  There's a significant need for efficient, affordable, and reliable data cleaning tools and services, particularly for those lacking expertise or resources.  Many also struggle to find appropriate training, mentorship, and readily available datasets for practice and skill development."
4,27,"Data cleaning is a significant bottleneck in data science projects, particularly when dealing with large datasets containing inconsistent formats, errors, and irrelevant information.  Users struggle to efficiently clean data using various tools and languages (Python, command-line tools), often requiring extensive manual effort or lacking the right tools for specific data types (e.g., JSON, text, HTML).  This results in significant time investment and hinders progress on downstream analysis or model building."
5,11,"The core pain point revolves around the challenges of building and deploying reliable AI systems, encompassing data quality issues, model explainability and trustworthiness, and the need for scalable and efficient machine learning workflows.  This includes difficulties in handling unstructured data, achieving robust performance across various tasks (like classification and clustering), and ensuring fairness and transparency in AI model outputs."
6,20,"The pervasive challenge across various industries is ensuring data quality, encompassing issues like inconsistent formatting (e.g., phone numbers), incomplete or uncleaned datasets (e.g., hospital prices), and biased or unrepresentative data leading to skewed insights (e.g., tourism data).  This poor data quality results in significant financial losses for businesses and hinders accurate analysis and decision-making.  The lack of readily available resources and clear understanding of data quality itself further compounds these problems."
7,34,"The core pain point is the difficulty and inefficiency of data cleaning, especially at scale.  This includes challenges in handling messy, inconsistent, and erroneous data from diverse sources,  requiring complex processes for data reconciliation, deduplication, and parsing to prepare data for analysis or machine learning.  Automated solutions and efficient tools for various data cleaning tasks are highly sought after."
8,15,"Data cleaning and preprocessing present significant challenges, encompassing inconsistent date formats, handling missing values (both numerical and categorical) in large datasets, and managing outliers and inconsistencies in data entries (e.g., negative total costs, inconsistent survey completion times).  Effective strategies for data imputation, outlier detection, and data transformation are needed to prepare datasets for analysis.  The lack of readily available resources specifically addressing cleaning challenges for categorical data and large, complex datasets also hinders progress."
9,28,"Data cleaning is a significant time-consuming challenge, frequently cited as the hardest part of data analysis, hindering efficiency and progress.  This difficulty stems from numerous issues including handling missing values, inconsistent data formats, and the need for effective strategies for categorical data preprocessing,  making it crucial for data professionals to develop robust cleaning skills.  A lack of readily available, sufficiently messy datasets for practice further exacerbates the problem."
