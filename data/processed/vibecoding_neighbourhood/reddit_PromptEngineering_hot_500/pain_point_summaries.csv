0,44,"Users struggle with managing and reusing LLM prompts effectively, leading to wasted time and frustration.  There's a need for improved tools and techniques to organize prompts, maintain conversation state across sessions, and ensure prompt privacy and security.  Additionally, many users desire more control over LLM behavior, including character customization and system prompt management."
1,20,"Several pain points emerge:  A lack of community support for Spanish-speaking bilingual data annotators is highlighted, indicating a need for improved networking and shared experience.  Additionally, difficulties in crafting effective prompts for AI models are recurrent, emphasizing the need for clearer instructions and better understanding of AI capabilities to achieve desired outcomes."
2,55,"The core pain points revolve around the limitations of traditional prompt engineering, especially when dealing with dynamic behavior and complex tasks.  Users struggle with prompt fragility, inconsistent outputs from even meticulously crafted prompts, and the need for extensive iterations to achieve reliable results. This leads to a search for alternative approaches and tools that move beyond iterative prompt refinement to manage complex logic and ensure consistent LLM behavior."
3,86,"Many users struggle to craft effective AI prompts, leading to inefficient workflows, subpar results, and wasted time.  There's a significant need for improved tools and resources to streamline prompt engineering, especially for complex tasks and diverse AI model usage.  Additionally, concerns exist regarding the reliability of AI-generated outputs, prompting a need for better accuracy and hallucination prevention."
4,57,"Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce unreliable outputs, including hallucinations and inconsistencies, making them unsuitable for applications requiring precise, predictable results.  Furthermore, LLMs struggle to accurately interpret nuanced human communication, leading to misinterpretations of intent and tone.  This lack of reliability and accurate interpretation hinders the development of robust and trustworthy AI systems for various applications, particularly in business contexts."
5,71,"Prompt engineers struggle with managing, organizing, and versioning their prompts across different LLMs and projects, leading to wasted time and inconsistent results.  There's a lack of effective tools for prompt creation, refinement, testing, and collaboration, hindering productivity and the ability to leverage the full potential of LLMs.  This results in difficulty finding, reusing, and iterating on effective prompts, especially for complex tasks and across teams."
6,41,"Large language models (LLMs) frequently exhibit inconsistencies in behavior, including context loss between interactions, unwanted rewriting or summarization of input text, and a tendency towards excessive verbosity or ""hallucinations.""  These inconsistencies hinder the reliable use of LLMs for complex tasks and necessitate significant prompt engineering efforts to achieve desired performance and prevent errors.  Furthermore,  building robust and reliable multi-agent systems using LLMs presents significant challenges related to prompt routing, context management, and error handling."
7,28,"Users struggle to generate high-quality, consistent, and stylistically controlled images using AI tools.  Difficulties include achieving lifelike results, maintaining desired layouts while changing styles, and accurately incorporating specific details like text on product labels within generated images.  Many users also lack the prompt engineering skills to overcome these challenges effectively."
8,53,"Many users struggle to craft effective prompts for large language models, leading to inconsistent or subpar results.  This difficulty is exacerbated by the constant evolution of models and the lack of readily available tools for prompt optimization and testing.  Furthermore, concerns exist regarding the security and monetization of custom-built GPTs, as well as the ethical implications of advanced AI capabilities."
9,45,"Many users struggle to create effective prompts for AI models, leading to unsatisfactory or inaccurate results.  This difficulty stems from a lack of clear structure,  inconsistent application of prompting techniques, and insufficient understanding of how to guide the AI effectively.  The need for improved prompt engineering skills and tools is prevalent across various domains, ranging from stock trading to software development."
